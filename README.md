# Personal_Portfolio_Website
I have build a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, projects, and accomplishments as a web developer. Designed an attractive and visually appealing layout that captures visitors' attention. Include a home page with a captivating headline, professional photo, and summary of my skills. Provide an "About Me" section with a detailed background, education, and professional experience.
